# Cyber-Security

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is a practice to ensure Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A).

1. **Network Security:**  
   The process of protecting the network from unwanted users, attacks, and intrusions.

2. **Application Security:**  
   Apps require constant updates and testing to ensure these programs are secure from attacks.

3. **Endpoint Security:**  
   Remote access is a necessary part of business, but can also be a weak point for data. Endpoint security is the process of protecting remote access to a company's network.

4. **Data Security:**  
   Inside of networks and applications is data. Protecting company and customer information is a separate layer of security.

5. **Identity Management:**  
   Authentication is an important part of security. Ensuring that only the right people have access to certain information is key.

6. **Database and Infrastructure Security:**  
   Everything in a network relies on the database and infrastructure. Keeping this information secure is a top priority.

7. **Cloud Security:**  
   As more businesses move to the cloud, securing data is an ongoing challenge.

8. **Mobile Security:**
    Mobile devices are now a part of the network. Ensuring these devices are secure is just as important as a desktop.

9. **Disaster Recovery/ Business Continuity Planning:**
    In the event of a breach, natural disaster, or other event, having a disaster recovery plan is essential.



## Networking

**IP Address** .
      1.  Every machine on a network has a unique identifier
      2.  Command to check IP in Linux env ( ifconfig or ip a )
      3.  Command to check IP in Windows env ( ipconfig )
      4.  IPv4 and IPv6
      5.  Public and Private IP

  - Public IP address are always unique across the internet.
  - Private IP address are unique within a network, but not across the internet.


   **IPV4**
  ```bash
      32 bits (4 Octets) - x.x.x.x   x=l octet (1 Octet = 8 bits)
      Example : 192.168.2.4
      192 in binary = 11000000 (8 bits)
      168 in binary = 10101000 (8 bits)
      2 in binary  = 00000010 (8 bits)
      4 in binary = 00000100 (8 bits)
      
      11000000.10101000.00000010.00000100
  ```
